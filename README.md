# Hide and Seek XR
Hide and Seek XR is an interactive mixed reality game that brings a fresh challenge to the classic hide-and-seek. One player takes on the role of the hider, strategically placing monsters in the real world. The seeker must track them down using hints and a monster radar before time runs out. Move around your space, scan your surroundings, and capture every hidden creature to win. Play with a friend that tests your observation skills and reaction time. Think fast, search carefully, and capture them all!
